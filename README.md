# HGSVC Haplotyping Pipeline
This repository contains a Snakefile (plus auxiliary scripts) to reproduce the haplotyping experiments reported by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC):

Chaisson et al., 2017. “Multi-Platform Discovery of Haplotype-Resolved Structural Variation in Human Genomes.” bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/193144.

The Snakefile will automatically download all required input files.
